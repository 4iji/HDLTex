## Installation ##

There are git RMDL in this repository; to clone all the needed files, please use:

    git clone --recursive https://github.com/kk7nc/HDLTex.git
     
     
The primary requirements for this package are Python 3 with Tensorflow. The requirements.txt file contains a listing of the required Python packages; to install all requirements, run the following:
    
    pip -r install requirements.txt
    
Or

    pip3  install -r requirements.txt

Or:

    conda install --file requirements.txt
        
If the above command does not work, use the following:

    sudo -H pip  install -r requirements.txt
